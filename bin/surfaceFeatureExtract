# Script
#     surfaceFeatureExtract
#
# Description
#     Script to suggest using the new "surfaceFeatures" utility.
#
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

cat <<EOF
$Script has been superseded by the "surfaceFeatures" utility.

surfaceFeatures reads a surfaceFeaturesDict input file with a much
simpler, more convenient format.  Example surfaceFeaturesDict files
can be found in the tutorial and template cases, e.g. located as
follows:
find \$FOAM_TUTORIALS -name surfaceFeaturesDict
find \$FOAM_ETC -name surfaceFeaturesDict

If you wish to run the old surfaceFeatureExtract application,
- EITHER run with full path, e.g.:
  $FOAM_APPBIN/surfaceFeatureExtract ...
- OR run with the additional -f | -force option, e.g.:
  surfaceFeatureExtract -force ...

EOF
exit 0
}

echo "$*" | grep -qE "\-(f|force)( |$)" || announcement

# shellcheck disable=SC2046
"$FOAM_APPBIN/surfaceFeatureExtract" \
    $(echo "$*" | sed -E "s/\-(f|force)( |$)//g")
